		<h1>Help and Advice on keeping a pug</h1>

    <h4>General Care</h4>
		<p><strong>Facial</strong>: The wrinkles accumulate a great deal of dirt etc, because Pugs spend a lot of time with their face mashed against the ground and in their food bowl. Therefore, cleaning the folds is essential to avoid them developing a fungus or infection. The only items you need are a cotton bud and a cup of warm water. A baby wipe will also do the task nicely. If a wrinkle gets sore, apply a little Sudocrem, available from the chemist. Clean 2-3 times weekly.</p>
		<p><strong>Nail Clipping</strong>: The pug’s nails grow extremely fast.!! You will need to cut your pug’s nails approximately every two weeks, start as soon as you get him/her home. The best time to cut your pug’s nails is while he/she is fast asleep on your lap at night. He/she may wake up, but hopefully won’t be motivated to put up a struggle. Keep some styptic powder handy in case you cut too far. To avoid cutting too far, simply cut the curved part of the nail only and make sure you have a steady hand. Alternatively, a vet or a dog groomer will do this for you for a fee. Be vigilant about their nails as being too long can cause discomfort for your dog and by not standing high enough on his paws will cause them to bleed and result in the breakdown of the pasterns causing long term discomfort.</p>
		<p><strong>Ear Cleaning</strong>: Using ‘Leo’ ear cleaner, place probe into ear, not to far, squirt approx 10ml and massage base of ear for 3 mins. Using a cotton wool ball wipe away the wax and dirt it’s brought to the surface. Do not push the cotton wool ball deep into the ear. After cleaning use a pinch of ‘Thornit’ powder into each ear. Check the ears weekly and clean when appropriate.</p>
		<p><strong>Teeth Cleaning</strong>: Provide ample chews which assist in cleaning your dog’s teeth. It is recommended to clean your dog’s teeth on a regular basis, Toothbrush and dog toothpaste is available from you local pet shop. Do not use human toothpaste this is unsuitable. Start cleaning your dog’s teeth as soon as you bring him home, to get him used to it. Alternatively, your vet will do this for you for a fee.</p>
		<p><strong>Coat Care</strong>: Your pug will shed copious amounts of hair. All you need is a brush, a flea comb and a chamois. Brushing your pug about twice a week keeps the coat nice and smooth and shiny and stimulates the skin.</p>
		<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Never Exercise your pug in very hot weather. With their elongated palate theywould soon be in distress. When travelling in hot weather, soak a towel and lay in the bottom of their travelling box. Always take water with you to cool them in an emergency. Your pug puppy must have plenty of rest and sleep. Do not allow to get too tired and excited with other dogs and children, as Pugs never know when to stop playing</p>
